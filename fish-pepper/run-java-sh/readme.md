The run script can be influenced by the following environment variables:

* **JAVA_APP_DIR** the directory where the application resides. All paths
  in your application are relative to this directory.
* **JAVA_LIB_DIR** directory holding the Java jar files as well an optional `classpath` 
  file which holds the classpath. Either as a single line classpath (colon separated) or 
  with jar files listed line-by-line. If not set **JAVA_LIB_DIR** is the same 
  as **JAVA_APP_DIR**. 
* **JAVA_OPTIONS** options to add when calling `java`
* **JAVA_MAIN_CLASS** A main class to use as argument for `java`. When
  this environment variable is given, all jar files in `$JAVA_APP_DIR`
  are added to the classpath as well as `$JAVA_LIB_DIR`.
* **JAVA_APP_JAR** A jar file with an appropriate manifest so that it
  can be started with `java -jar` if no `$JAVA_MAIN_CLASS` is set. In all
  cases this jar file is added to the classpath, too.
* **JAVA_APP_NAME** Name to use for the process
* **JAVA_CLASSPATH** the classpath to use. If not given, the script checks 
  for a file `${JAVA_APP_DIR}/classpath` and use its content literally 
  as classpath. If this file doesn't exists all jars in the app dir are 
  added (`classes:${JAVA_APP_DIR}/*`). 
* **JAVA_ENABLE_DEBUG** If set remote debugging will be switched on
* **JAVA_DEBUG_PORT** Port used for remote debugging. Default: 5005

If neither `$JAVA_APP_JAR` nor `$JAVA_MAIN_CLASS` is given,
`$JAVA_APP_DIR` is checked for a single JAR file which is taken as
`$JAVA_APP_JAR`. If no or more then one jar file is found, the script
throws an error. 

The classpath is build up with the following parts:

* If `$JAVA_CLASSPATH` is set, this classpath is taken.
* The current directory (".") is added first.
* If the current directory is not the same as `$JAVA_APP_DIR`, `$JAVA_APP_DIR` is added. 
* If `$JAVA_MAIN_CLASS` is set, then 
  - A `$JAVA_APP_JAR` is added if set
  - If a file `$JAVA_APP_DIR/classpath` exists, its content is appended to the classpath. This file 
    can be either a single line with the jar files colon separated or a multi-line file where each line
    holds the path of the jar file relative to `$JAVA_LIB_DIR` (which by default is the `$JAVA_APP_DIR`)
  - If this file is not set, a `${JAVA_APP_DIR}/*` is added which effectively adds all 
    jars in this directory in alphabetical order. 

These variables can be also set in a
shell config file `run-env.sh`, which will be sourced by 
the startup script. This file can be located in the directory where 
this script is located and in `${JAVA_APP_DIR}`, whereas environment 
variables in the latter override the ones in `run-env.sh` from the script 
directory.

This script also checks for a command `run-java-options`. If existant it will be
called and the output is added to the environment variable `$JAVA_OPTIONS`.

Any arguments given during startup are taken over as arguments to the
Java app.
